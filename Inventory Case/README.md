The repository includes:

**Inventory Case - sample.pdf**: A detailed explanation of the problem setup, methodology, and simulation results.

**Inventory Case - sample.py**: Python code implementing the simulation model. It computes critical Type-1 and Type-2 service levels and tracks total cost across multiple periods.

To run the code, simply open the Python script in your preferred environment, ensure standard data-science libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas) are installed, and execute.
