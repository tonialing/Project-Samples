# Project-Samples

This repository contains two project samples that demonstrate how I apply supply chain methods and data analytics skills to solve real-world problems. Note that they may not appear fully cohesive because they were originally team-based; here, I have included only the sections I completed independently, particularly the **model development** work.

The **Inventory Project** showcases a simulation-based study of a **centralized echelon base-stock policy** in a multi-stage supply chain under uncertain demand. I developed the model using a **stochastic-service model (SSM) framework** in a periodic review system, comparing normal versus heavy-tailed (Student-t) demand distributions. This highlights how heavier-tailed demand can lead to greater variability in both holding and backlog costs. My primary contribution lies in formulating and coding the supply chain model that computes key metrics such as Type-1 and Type-2 service levels, as well as total system costs.
