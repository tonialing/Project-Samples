# Project-Samples

This repository contains two project samples showcasing how I apply **supply chain methods and operations research skills** to solve real-world problems. They may not appear fully cohesive because they were originally team-based; here, I have included only the sections I completed independently, particularly the **model development and data analysis** work.

**Inventory Case**
This project is a simulation-based study of a **centralized echelon base-stock policy** in a multi-stage supply chain with uncertain demand. I developed the model using a **stochastic-service model (SSM) framework** in a periodic review system, comparing normal and heavy-tailed (Student-t) demand distributions. This highlights how heavier-tailed demand increases variability in holding and backlog costs. My main contribution lies in **formulating and coding the supply chain model** that calculates key metrics like Type-1/Type-2 service levels and total costs.

**Delivery Schedule Case**
This project focuses on designing a **new weekly delivery schedule** that **balances cost efficiency and sustainability**. The retailer aims to integrate more **electric trucks**, despite their higher per-kilometer costs, to reduce CO₂ emissions. I created a mathematical model using Python and Gurobi, simulating multiple delivery scenarios over six days for 49 stores. Key constraints include separate docks for fresh vs ambient products, truck-type limitations, and multi-store routes. Note that collaborative elements—such as extended scenario modeling and advanced clustering (e.g., **K-means**)—are excluded; only my **model formulation and data analysis** work is provided here.
