# Project-Samples

This repository contains two project samples, which demonstrate how I apply supply chain methods and data analytics skills to solve real-world problems. Note: they may not appear as fully cohesive projects because they were originally team-based. However, the examples here only reflect the work I completed independently, with any collaborative sections removed.


The "Inventory Project" contains a simulation-based project examining how a centralized echelon base-stock policy performs in a multi-stage supply chain facing uncertain demand. The study focuses on a stochastic-service model (SSM) framework in a periodic review system, where random demand follows either a normal or a heavy-tailed (Student-t) distribution. By comparing these distributions, it highlights how more unpredictable, heavy-tailed demands can increase both holding and backlog costs.

In addition, this project and create a simulation model to evaluate the networking operating, demonstrating improved performance in terms of service levels and overall cost, Further recommendations include introducing the capacity constraint across different nodes:
supplier (S), distributor (D), and customer (C), to assess how these constraints affect the
overall performance of the supply chain, particularly in terms of cost and service levels. analyzes the impact of capacity constraints at different nodes (supplier, distributor, or customer)
