The repository includes:

**Delivery Case - sample.pdf**: A detailed explanation of the problem setup, constraints, and optimization methodology. 

**Delivery Case - sample.py**: Python code implementing the Gurobi optimization model. It simulates various delivery scenarios over six days for 49 stores, accounting for truck-type limitations, separate docks, and multi-store routes.

To run the code, simply open the Python script in your preferred environment, ensure standard data-science libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas) are installed, and execute.
